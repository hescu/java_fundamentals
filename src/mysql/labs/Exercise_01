 * MySQL Exercise 1:
 *
 *      Using MySQLWorkbench,
 *
 *      1.) If you haven't already, create the college database as instructed here:
 *              https://platform.codingnomads.co/learn/mod/page/view.php?id=2133
 *      2.) Create a new table "students" with the following fields:
 *          a. id (auto increment)
 *          b. first_name
 *          c. age
 *
 *      3.) Create a new table "teachers_students" with the following fields:
 *          a. id (auto increment)
 *          b. student_id
 *          c. teacher_id
 *
 *      4.) Create a new table "teachers" with the following fields:
 *          a. id (auto increment)
 *          b. first_name
 *          c. last_name
 *          d. subject
 *
 *      5.) Create the appropriate foreign key constraints in the "teachers_students" table.
 *
 *      6.) Populate each table with at least 5 records. Use the "teachers_students" to associate various
 *          teachers with various students.
 *
 *      7.) Write queries (and paste them below) for each of the following tasks:
 *          a. select all students
                select * from students

 *          b. select all teacher who teach "Math" (choose a subject you included)
                select * from teachers where subject='Latin'

 *          c. use a join query to select all students with a certain teacher
                select s.first_name, s.last_name from students s
                join teachers_students ts on s.id = ts.student_id
                join teachers t on ts.teacher_id = t.id
                where t.last_name = 'Murray'

 *          d. use a join query to select all students with taking a certain subject
                select s.first_name, s.last_name from students s
                join teachers_students ts on s.id = ts.student_id
                join teachers t on ts.teacher_id = t.id
                where t.subject = 'chemistry'

 *          e. update a record in the student table
                update students set age = 62 where id = 5

 *          f. add a record to the teacher table
                insert into teachers (first_name, last_name, subject)
                values ('Turk', 'Turkelson', 'biology')
 *
 *       8.) Export the schema to a dump file and copy it to this folder.
